## Perl program to query National Weather Service

This scirpt queries for the XML for KSLI Los Alamitos, parses it up,
and stores it to a memcache server for later pickup from a webserver.  It
also stores a summary data line on the end of the script.

This is my experiment with automated Docker builds.
